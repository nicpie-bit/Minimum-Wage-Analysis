* Living Wage: https://livingwage.mit.edu/

## Github link: https://github.com/shalynalavoie/Minimum-Wage-Project.git

## Heroku APP: https://app-wages.herokuapp.com/

## Graphs:
* Bar Chart with dropdown that graphs minimum wage by state with the dropdown allowing you to choose the year (using chart.js)
* Line Graph with filter that compares a state’s minimum wage with the federal minimum wage over time with a filter for state (using D3)
* Hexagonal Map with filter - map of the United States with the states colored by living wage with a filter that categorizes by family (ex: 1 adult 0 kids, or 2 adults 2 kids) with a tool tip that comes up whenever you hover over the state (using highcharts)
